					<p>Starting my career as a classically trained Graphic Designer, I worked primarily on print projects, including presentations, packaging, flyers and trade show booths. This was during an era that was before the rise of inexpensive stock art that you can download in seconds, so many of my designs feature custom art/illustration.</p>
					<p>As my career exposure grew, I quickly fell in love with user interactivity on the web, as well as animation, design for motion and video production, but I have never left behind my foundational training as a Graphic Designer. These design skills are still very much the basis of my current work in motion graphics and UX/UI.</p>
