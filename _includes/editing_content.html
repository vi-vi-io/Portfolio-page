					<p>My over 10 years professional editing experience was acquired partly at an in-house corporate agency and then as an established freelancer working on a broad range of production types. Unscripted editing is is one of my signature skills. I thrive on the challenge of working through primary and b-roll footage to shape a cohesive story arc that captivates audiences.</p>
					<p>My specialty lies in documentary, journalistic, corporate, and educational films. With a well-honed research process and thoughtful storytelling, I can craft candid and captivating video messaging that resonates with your target audience.</p>
					<p>My primary tools for post productions are in Adobe Premiere/After Effects and Davinci Resolve, but Iâ€™m comfortable working in any NLE system that is established in your organization.</p>
