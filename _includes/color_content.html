					<p>As a color grading and correction expert, I understand the importance of shot matching&mdash;balancing exposure and tint across different cameras and lighting situations, making the footage look like it was shot at the same time and place, ensuring that the finished piece is consistent and professional.</p>
					<p>I can bring out the beauty thatâ€™s hidden in any LOG footage, but I have special expertise with the BRAW format from Black Magic cameras. Using the powerful color tab in DaVinci Resolve, I can set the mood and look of your film by defining its colors, creating a cohesive and polished final product.</p>
