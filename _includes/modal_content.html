					<p>As a skilled story-boarder, I can help you bring your ideas to life visually. But it's not just about the visuals. Strategy is key to ensuring that your video achieves its intended purpose. That's why I work closely with clients to understand their goals, so we can develop a strategy that aligns with their brand and message.</p>
					<p>Once we have a solid plan in place, the script becomes the backbone of the video production process. Developed with years of experince on-set and in post, I have a grasp of what "works" for video. This fundamental understanding will help us craft a script that its not only engaging, but also informative, ensuring that your message comes across loud and clear.</p>

					<p>My over 10 years professional editing experience was acquired partly at an in-house corporate agency and then as an established freelancer working on a broad range of production types. Unscripted editing is is one of my signature skills. I thrive on the challenge of working through primary and b-roll footage to shape a cohesive story arc that captivates audiences.</p>
					<p>My specialty lies in documentary, journalistic, corporate, and educational films. With a well-honed research process and thoughtful storytelling, I can craft candid and captivating video messaging that resonates with your target audience.</p>
					<p>My primary tools for post productions are in Adobe Premiere/After Effects and Davinci Resolve, but I’m comfortable working in any NLE system that is established in your organization.</p>

					<p>As a color grading and correction expert, I understand the importance of shot matching&mdash;balancing exposure and tint across different cameras and lighting situations, making the footage look like it was shot at the same time and place, ensuring that the finished piece is consistent and professional.</p>
					<p>I can bring out the beauty that’s hidden in any LOG footage, but I have special expertise with the BRAW format from Black Magic cameras. Using the powerful color tab in DaVinci Resolve, I can set the mood and look of your film by defining its colors, creating a cohesive and polished final product.</p>

					<p>	As a skilled interviewer, I have a proven track record of working with talent to capture compelling and authentic stories. My approach is rooted in compassion for the subject and a commitment to making them feel comfortable and heard. I am always prepared for unexpected responses, and know how to follow up or ask for more information to ensure that the answers feel natural and unrehearsed.</p>
					<p>Whether in-studio or on-location, I have extensive experience with a range of professional camera brands, including Black Magic, Canon, Panasonic, and Sony. I am also proficient in mic'ing subjects, sound mixing, and setting up three-point lighting to create the perfect shot. In addition, I am adept at operating sliders and gimbals to capture dynamic and visually stunning secondary shots and b-roll.</p>
					<p>With a small kit that includes a 4k camera, a variety of lenses, 4 pc. bi-color light kit, lav and boom mics, I can stay nimble for one-man-band style gigs, or I can quickly scale up with more equipment and production staff for more complex shoots.</p>
					<p>Overall, my skills in interviewing, directing, and camera operation make me an ideal partner for any shoot that requires a high level of professionalism, creativity, and technical expertise.</p>
